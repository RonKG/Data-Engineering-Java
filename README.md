This project demonstrates proficiency in Core Java and (ANSI) SQL. I used Java to build a backend program that performs some basic and advanced database operations on a MySQL RDBMS. By the end of the project, 
I have demonstrated how to add, delete and alter db entries. The main database is created from a SQL script provided in this repository. The connection to the db is achieved through a JDBC Driver.

The java folders and classes are organized as follows:
